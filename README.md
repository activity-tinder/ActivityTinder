## Overview
### Description
Have you ever wanted to hang out with a group of friends, but have no idea what do to? Do you have no friends, but want to do something?

This app will help individuals meet people that they want to hang out or do specific activities with. It will allow them to specify what activity they want to do and find a group or join a group that already plans on doing that activity.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:**
    - social, meeting people irl (literally Tinder for friends)
- **Mobile:**
    - it's very convenient on the phone
    - most popular messenger apps are all for mobile
    - good for traveling
    - FB Messenger
    - Google Maps
- **Story:**
    - It orginally started off as solving the FB BFF issue, but quickly expaneded to being able to be used in other enterprises
    - can easily expand to general tech consumers who want to get out and do stuff and meet new people
    - Tinder for people who don't want to go out on dates, but want to have a (platonic) good time
- **Market:**
    - Facebook employees (initially)
    - The general public looking to have a platonic good time
- **Habit:**
    - Aveage user can create an event twice or three times a month
        - But coming back to the app to plan the event would be customized based on when the user joined the activity group and how frequently the gorup corresponds
    - user can decide how often they want to go out
    - if they already have a group that they just want to easily plan outings with, they can visit often whenever the group wnts to go out
- **Scope:**
    - it hopefully can be done
    - biggest issue seems to be what to add as required stories
        - could easily expand and lose focus on the main core of the app
